I used this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/21FnnGKSRZo?si=4FFpCUjm8x0jBD2K) to create a story generator similar to madlibs. 
It has stories that consist within text files that have interchangable words. 
The user will be prompted to write a word that matches a certain type of word such as an adjective, place, person, etc.
These words will then be placed in the spot of that type of word in the story allowing the user's story to be printed back to them
at the end of the program.
